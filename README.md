# ‚ôªÔ∏è Recyclizer

An AI-powered image classification app that identifies and categorizes waste into four classes: **Recyclable, Non-Recyclable, Hazardous, and Organic**. Using transfer learning with a fine-tuned ResNet50 model, it achieves **97% training accuracy**, **95% validation accuracy**, and strong F1 scores.
