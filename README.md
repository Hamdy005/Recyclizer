♻️ Recyclizer

This project is an AI-powered image classification application that identifies and categorizes waste items into four classes: Recyclable, Non-Recyclable, Hazardous, and Organic. It uses transfer learning with a fine-tuned ResNet50 model, achieving 97% training accuracy, 95% validation accuracy, and strong F1 scores.


📊 Features

  - High-accuracy classification of waste images into four categories

  - Visualization of dataset distribution to analyze class balance

  - Training and validation accuracy curves to monitor model learning

  - Confusion matrix and classification report for detailed performance analysis



🗂️ Waste Categories

  - Recyclable: Plastic, Cardboard, Paper, Metal, Glass, Clothes, Shoes

  - Non-Recyclable: Everyday litter (e.g., chip bags, candy wrappers, used tissues), toothpaste tubes, disposable face masks

  - Hazardous: Batteries and other potentially harmful materials

  - Organic: Food waste and biological materials



🚀 Deployment

  - Interactive web demo built with Streamlit

  - Planned mobile deployment
